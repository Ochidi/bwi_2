Discrepancies between your directory (esmaras) and whatever computer you're putting it on need to be taken care of.
Also, in some places, the files are trying to get to wifi_localization/wifi_lookup instead of the bwi folder.
No longer using bwi in ros folder. Now using bwi_2 in ros/rosbuild_ws folder.
Added stuff to my own github because I don't know Eric's password. :P
